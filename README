pytextpreprocess

    by Joseph Turian

Preprocess text for NLP (tokenizing, lowercasing, stemming, sentence splitting, etc.)

REQUIREMENTS:
    * My Python common library:
        http://github.com/turian/common
    and sub-requirements thereof.
    * NLTK, for word tokenization

The English stoplist is from:
    http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume5/lewis04a/a11-smart-stop-list/english.stop
However, I added words at the top (above "a").
